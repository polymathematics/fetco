# documentation

1. **Initialization and Authentication**

   - **isAuthed**: Checks if the user is authenticated by fetching a flag from local storage.

   - **authorize()**: Initiates the Spotify authorization flow, including generating a code challenge and redirecting the user to Spotify for approval.

   - **handleRedirect()**: Handles the redirection after Spotify authorization, retrieves the authorization code, exchanges it for an access token, and fetches the user's profile.

   - **getProfile(accessToken)**: Retrieves the authenticated user's profile information from Spotify.

2. **Playback Control**

   - **initializePlayer(accessToken)**: Initializes the Spotify Web Playback SDK player and connects it. This is what makes Fetco available as a connected device within Spotify. We then select it as the device by calling transferPlaybackToDevice.

   - **playMusic(player)**: Plays a track using the Spotify API, adjusts volume, and seeks to a random start time before playing. Due to Spotify limitations, this currently utilizes the listener's existing Spotify queue.

   - **playPodcast(player)**: Plays a random podcast episode fetched from the podcast JSON file using the Listen Notes API and seeks to a random start time (less than or equal to 16 mins into ep).

   - **transferPlaybackToDevice(accessToken, deviceId)**: Transfers playback to Fetco automatically, using the Spotify API.

3. **Content Decision and Playback Execution**

   - **contentDecision(player)**: Randomly selects between playing music or a podcast and triggers either playMusic or playPodcast.

   - **scan()**: Triggers when a listener selects the scan knob. Initiates content decision and playback.

   - **powerButton(player)**: Toggles the application on or off based on a local storage flag, initiates content decision and playback when turned on.

4. **Utility Functions**

   - **generateRandomString(length)**: Generates a random alphanumeric string of a specified length.

   - **generateCodeChallenge(codeVerifier)**: Generates a code challenge for OAuth authorization using SHA-256 hashing.

5. **Event Handling**

   - **Player event listeners**: Fetco utilizes event listeners throughout for events such as Spotify player readiness.


### Notes

- The application primarily utilizes the Spotify API for music playback and OAuth authorization.
- It integrates with the Listen Notes API for fetching and playing podcast episodes.
- Local storage is used for maintaining authentication state and application settings.
